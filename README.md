A small Bash script for the command line that allows you to shorten URLs using the 4or.de URL shortener service.
It is easy to use on the command line and can be easily customized. I built it to quickly and conveniently shorten URLs via the terminal on Mac and Linux for use on social media platforms like Threads, Bluesky, and Twitter (X.com). After shortening, it simply outputs the short URL.

Please note that you need an API key from the 4or.de URL shortener service to use this script. To get one, you need to create an account, but this also works with the free account.

Once logged in, you can find the API key under: **Home > Account > API**.

Why 4or.de? It is DSGVO/GDPR-compliant and does not store unnecessary data, making it a good choice for use in Germany. Additionally, the domain is quite neutral.
